    "text": "**What It Is**  \nThe flat character isn’t just the one-note sidekick, the stereotypical villain, or the background figure who exists to fill space. Forget the clichés—cardboard cutouts, predictable props, or “simple” characters who lack depth. The flat character is a force, a steady anchor that holds the story’s world together, providing stability, contrast, or momentum without shifting themselves. They’re the constant in the narrative experiment, the element that doesn’t change but makes everything else possible. A flat character can be a person—the grumpy shopkeeper in a small-town tale, the loyal guard in a fantasy epic—but they can also be a place, like a unchanging village, or a symbol, like a flag that stands firm. The flat character is whatever stays steady, grounding the story’s chaos or amplifying its stakes.\n\nAt its core, the flat character is about *consistency*. They’re the force that remains fixed, offering a stable backdrop against which the hero’s spark, the villain’s resistance, or the round character’s evolution can shine. They don’t need to be boring or shallow—just unchanging, reliable, or predictable in their role. Whether it’s a stern teacher who never softens, a town that never wavers, or a rule that never bends, the flat character is the force that says, “This is the world,” and lets the story build around it. Their power lies in their steadfastness, providing structure, contrast, or clarity without stealing the spotlight.\n\nThe flat character is the story’s foundation. They don’t evolve like round characters, but they make evolution possible by giving the narrative a steady base to push against, lean on, or break from. They’re the force that keeps the story grounded, even as it soars, twists, or burns.",

    "text": "**The Deep Dive: What Makes a Flat Character**  \nPicture a story as a chemical reaction: the hero sparks it, the villain fights it, the mentor shapes it, the sidekick amplifies it, the foil reveals it, the round character transforms it. The flat character is the stable compound, the element that doesn’t react or change but holds the reaction together. They’re the beaker that contains the chaos, the constant that lets other forces shine. They can be a person, like the Sheriff of Nottingham in *Robin Hood*, unwavering in his greed, or something else—a rigid law, a stoic mountain, a community that never sways. Their role is to stabilize, contrast, or propel, making the story’s world solid and its changes sharper.\n\nWhat defines the flat character as a force? Three key traits:  \n1. **Consistency**: Flat characters don’t evolve or reveal new layers. Their traits, values, or roles remain steady, providing a predictable anchor for the story.  \n2. **Function**: They serve a clear purpose—advancing the plot, grounding the world, or contrasting others—without drawing focus to their own inner lives.  \n3. **Clarity**: Their simplicity makes other characters’ complexity or the story’s stakes stand out. They’re the foil, backdrop, or catalyst that highlights change.\n\nFlat characters don’t need to be simplistic or unimportant. A king who’s always just, like Ned Stark’s honor in *Game of Thrones*, can be flat yet vital. They don’t need to be human—a rigid system, like the Capitol’s rules in *The Hunger Games*, can be a flat character if it stays unchanging. They don’t even need to be minor—the villain or mentor can be flat if their role is consistent, like Sauron’s unrelenting evil in *The Lord of the Rings*. The flat character’s job is to hold steady, not to grow or surprise.\n\nFlat characters can be central or peripheral, singular or collective. A single figure, like a stern parent who never wavers, can be flat, as can a group, like a town that clings to tradition. Their power lies in their reliability, offering a fixed point that makes the story’s transformations, conflicts, or revelations more vivid. They’re the force that says, “This is how it is,” letting others push against or lean on that truth.\n\nThe flat character’s role also shifts in scope. Early on, they might be a minor constant—a shopkeeper who’s always grumpy. Later, they could be a larger force, like a society that resists change, amplifying the hero’s struggle. Their steadiness is their strength, ensuring the story has a foundation to build on, no matter how wild the reaction gets.",

You’ve felt their force: the moment something or someone was so consistent it shaped your world, whether it grounded you, frustrated you, or gave you something to push against. Maybe it was a boss who was always strict, a friend who was predictably loyal, or a place that felt frozen in time. That’s the flat character’s energy—the unwavering presence that defines the edges of your story.\n\nThink about it. You’ve been the hero, sparking change, or the round character, evolving through it, but you’ve also lived with constants: the coworker who’s always cheerful, the rule that never budged, the home that stayed the same no matter where you went. These forces didn’t grow or surprise—they just *were*, shaping your path by being steady. Maybe they gave you stability, like a friend who never wavered, or pushed you to rebel, like a system that wouldn’t bend. You know what it feels like to navigate a world with fixed points.\n\nAs a writer, you carry this energy. You’ve lived with forces that stayed constant, grounding or challenging your growth. The flat character in your story isn’t just a “simple” figure—it’s the part of you that’s leaned on or pushed against something unchanging.

And they don’t need to be human—a rigid system, like the government in *1984*, can be a flat character, shaping the story without evolving.\n\nFinally, writers think flat characters are always simple.
