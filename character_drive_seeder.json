If motivation is the why behind what a character wants, drive is the how they chase it. It’s the restless energy, the constant push forward, the instinctual patterns and choices that keep a character moving, even when they don’t consciously think about it. Drive isn’t just grand gestures or decisions; it’s the everyday behaviors, the way a character shows up in the world, the rhythms that define how they pursue what matters.",
