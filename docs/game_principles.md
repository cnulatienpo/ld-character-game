- First contact: new ideas appear only in seeds, in generous prose.
- Generosity: quizzes show full paragraphs (2–3+), not scraps.
- Gradual language: dialect 1 → 4; advanced terms unlock only after lessons introduce them.
- Never stranded: games never ask for actions or terms the player hasn’t seen in a seed.
- Plain voice: UI copy uses human language.
- Data guardrail: each item has requires_vocabulary.
- Pacing loop: lesson → gentle play → reflection → deeper play.
