                    Do you not know shit about writing or you suck at it? Me too. I made these games to learn
                    grammar, character, narrative structure, and of course — the literary devices. You write,
                    you read, you get feedback. It’s a lot like an interactive textbook on creative writing.
                    If you know how to write already you will probably get bored. Thanks for playing.
